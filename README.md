# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The primary goal is to build a deep learning model capable of automatically classifying color images into ten distinct categories: airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains **60,000 images**, each of size **32x32 pixels**, divided into **50,000 training images** and **10,000 testing images**, making it a standard benchmark for image classification tasks in computer vision research and applications.

## Key Features of the Project

- **Frameworks Used:** 
  - TensorFlow and Keras are utilized for constructing and training the CNN model.
  - These frameworks provide a high-level API for building, compiling, and evaluating deep learning models efficiently.

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - All images are **normalized** to a pixel value range of [0,1] to ensure faster convergence during training and stable learning.
  - The class labels are **converted to one-hot encoding**, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks and works with categorical cross-entropy loss.

- **Data Augmentation:** 
  - Techniques applied include **random rotations**, **width and height shifts**, and **horizontal flips**.
  - Augmentation increases the diversity of the training dataset, helping the CNN learn **invariant features** and improving generalization to unseen test images.

- **CNN Architecture:**
  - The network consists of **three convolutional layers**, each followed by a **max-pooling layer**, which progressively extracts hierarchical features from the images.
  - **ReLU activation** is used to introduce non-linearity in the convolutional layers.
  - The extracted features are flattened and passed through a **Dense layer with 64 neurons** to combine high-level features.
  - The **output layer** has **10 neurons with softmax activation**, producing probability distributions over the ten classes.

- **Training Details:** 
  - Optimizer: **Adam**
  - Loss function: **Categorical cross-entropy**
  - Batch size: 64
  - Number of epochs: 20
  - Training is monitored using **training and validation accuracy and loss**, which are plotted for performance visualization.

- **Evaluation on Test Data:** 
  - **Test accuracy** is calculated to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen images.
  - A **classification report** is generated using scikit-learn to provide precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
  - A **confusion matrix** is plotted as a heatmap to visualize misclassifications and understand model strengths and weaknesses.

- **Visualization of Predictions:** 
  - Randomly selected test images are displayed along with **predicted and true labels** for qualitative verification of model performance.
  - This step helps identify any challenging classes and visually demonstrates the modelâ€™s classification capability.

- **Benefits of the Project:** 
  - Provides a complete **workflow for CNN-based image classification**.
  - Demonstrates best practices for **data preprocessing, augmentation, model building, training, and evaluation**.
  - Offers **visual insights** into model performance using plots, confusion matrices, and sample predictions.
  - Serves as an excellent learning resource for experimenting with **deep learning techniques in computer vision**.

## Summary

In summary, this project covers the **end-to-end process of image classification** using CNNs. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, CNN architecture design, training, evaluation on a test dataset, and visualization of results. The project highlights both **practical implementation** and **performance analysis**, making it suitable for beginners and advanced learners interested in computer vision and deep learning.
